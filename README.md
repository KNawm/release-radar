## GitHub CLI 1.0

GitHub CLI brings GitHub to your terminal. It reduces context switching, helps you focus, and enables you to more easily script and create your own workflows.
With GitHub CLI 1.0, you can:

Run your entire GitHub workflow from the terminal, from issues through releases
Call the GitHub API to script nearly any action, and set a custom alias for any command
Connect to GitHub Enterprise Server in addition to GitHub.com

## npm CLI v7.0.0

npm 7 comes with some long-awaited and requested features including:

- Workspaces: a set of features to the npm CLI that provide support to managing multiple packages from within a singular top-level, root package
- Automatically installing peer dependencies: prior to npm 7 developers needed to manage and install their own peer dependencies. The new peer dependency algorithm ensures that a validly matching peer dependency is found at or above the peer-dependentâ€™s location in the node_modules tree.
- package-lock v2 and support for yarn.lock: Our new package-lock format will unlock the ability to do deterministically reproducible builds and includes everything npm will need to fully build the package tree. Prior to npm 7 yarn.lock files were ignored, the npm cli can now use yarn.lock as source of package metadata and resolution guidance.
